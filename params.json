It includes contig assembly, blastn, filters for contamination reads, and consensus sequence calling. Users are advised to refer the end-to-end laboratory protocol described by Lee, et al. 2016 [1]. The users are encouraged to modify the FluSeq program written in simple python scripts for other clinical virus amplicon-based HTS method.\r\n\r\n### Reference:\r\n[1] Hong Kai Lee, Chun Kiat Lee, Julian Wei-Tze Tang, Tze Ping Loh, and Evelyn Siew-Chuan Koay. Pairwise comparison of contamination-controlled high-throughput and Sanger sequencing for influenza A genome sequencing.
