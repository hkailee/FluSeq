  "body": "### Welcome to FluSeq Page.\r\nFluSeq is a bioinformatics program developed and tested for an influenza A genome-wide amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) method, using Illumina Miseq system [1]. It includes contigs assembly, blastn, filters for in-run contamination reads, and consensus sequence calling. Users are advised to refer the end-to-end laboratory protocol described by Lee, et al. 2016 [1]. Users are encouraged to modify the FluSeq program written in python scripts for other clinical virus amplicon-based HTS methods.\r\n\r\n### Reference:\r\n[1] Hong Kai Lee, Chun Kiat Lee, Julian Wei-Tze Tang, Tze Ping Loh, and Evelyn Siew-Chuan Koay.
