It includes contig assembly, blastn, filters for contamination reads, and consensus sequence calling. Users are advised to refer the end-to-end laboratory protocol described by Lee, et al. 2016 [1]. The users are encouraged to modified the FluSeq program written in simple python scripts for other clinical virus amplicon-based HTS method.\r\n\r\n### Reference:\r\n[1] Hong Kai Lee, Chun Kiat Lee, Julian Wei-Tze Tang, Tze Ping Loh, and Evelyn Siew-Chuan Koay. Pairwise comparison of contamination-controlled high-throughput and Sanger sequencing for influenza A genome sequencing. [Article in preparation]\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-71299750-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
